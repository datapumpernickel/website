## Abstract

The dataset contains all resolutions of the United Nations between session 49 (1995/1996) and 78 (2023/2024) until January 2024 as well as newly developed issue categories that allow for in-depth analysis of voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly. The issue categories are based on the subjects used by the UN. Metadata for each resolution, such as information on the authorship, as well as corresponding draft resolutions were collected through webscraping and subsequently cleaned from the UN Digital Library website.
