    "text": "Measuring party contributions\nTo systematically evaluate the impact of different party programs on the coalition agreement, I will take two simple metrics.\n\nhow many sentences reach an arbitrary high threshold of similarity (0.8 and 0.9 respectively)?\nhow often does a party have the most similar sentence in a party program in a pairwise comparison with the coalition agreement\n\nIn the following table, we can see that for very similar sentences with a similarity of higher than .9, all parties contributed an almost equal amount of sentences, about 30. If we lower this threshold, we can see that the greens contribute a significantly higher share of similar sentences, almost twice as many as the other coalition partners. This might be due to the party program of the greens being much longer and hence possible accounting for many more variations of similar policy areas or even covering policy areas much more exhaustively.\nIf we look at the amount of times the Greens contributed the most fitting sentence for a given sentence in the coalition agreement, the difference is even more staggering. For more than 53% of sentences, the greens are the program that is most similar, with SPD and FDP contributing an almost equal share of the remaining ~ 46%.\n\n\nTable\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Highscoring Party Contributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty High Scores\n\n\nby cosine similarity\n\n\nParty\n\nSimilarity &gt;=\n\nHighest score across parties\n\n\n.8\n.9\n\n\n\n\nFDP\n339\n25\n744\n\n\nGRUENE\n656\n33\n1718\n\n\nSPD\n386\n36\n731\n\n\n\nOf a total of 3193 sentences in the coalition agreement.

Excluding sentences shorter than 20 characters.*\")))|&gt;\n  tab_spanner(label = md(\"**Similarity &gt;=**\"), columns = c(\"score_over_80\", \"score_over_90\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at this through the lens of the distribution of similarity scores this picture becomes more nuanced. It is clearly visible that the greens have a higher median score, in 50% of the cases between 0.7 and 0.8 round about, but it becomes clear that the most similar sentence might not always be the most similar by far or the decision might be far from clear.\n\n\nPlot\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of sentence similarity scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(clean_data)+\n  geom_violin(aes(toupper(party), score, fill = party), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(toupper(party), score), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_fill_manual(\n                    values = list(\n    \"FDP\" = paletteer::paletteer_d(\"lisa::FridaKahlo\")[4],\n    \"GRUENE\" = paletteer::paletteer_d(\"lisa::FridaKahlo\")[2],\n    \"SPD\" = paletteer::paletteer_d(\"lisa::FridaKahlo\")[5]\n  )) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of sentence similarity scores\", subtitle = \"across parties\",  x = \"\", y = \"Similarity Score\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1))\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to validate this a bit further it makes sense to look at two groups of sentences. One, where the variance of scores in between the most similar sentence for each party is high, hence we would explain a clear winner of one party program that contributed. Two, where the variance is very little, to see how well our sentence similarity scores for cases where all three party programs are all related to the coalition agreement to a similar degree.\nFor the first case, we look at three sentences from the coalition agreement, where the variance is high. In two, the greens win by far, because they simply contributed this specific sentence which does not even appear remotely related to any sentence in the other party programs (in dark green). In the third case, related to a minimum wage, the SPD takes the crown by a small margin. This is actually not really true. Qualitatively the sentence of the greens is more similar, as it simply states the raising of a minimum wage to 12€ (although it mentions to so immediately, which is absent from the coalition agreement), the SPD goes much further to imply that they want to raise it beyond 12€ eventually, which in the wording of the coalition agreement is clearly ruled out (one-time raise). Hence I would qualitatively say the greens are closer, however this is an edge case where both parties have clearly contributed to the agreement.\n\n\nTable\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Highest variance in scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest variance in scores\n\n\nby variance of cosine similarity\n\n\nParty\n\nTexts\n\nCosine Similarity\nVariance\n\n\nCoalition Agreement\nParty Program\n\n\n\n\nFDP\nwir treiben die un-dekade für menschen afrikanischer herkunft voran (z.\nmachen wir den weg frei für diese entwicklung!\n0.6156\n0.04478\n\n\nSPD\nwir treiben die un-dekade für menschen afrikanischer herkunft voran (z.\ndie partnerschaft zwischen europa und afrika wollen wir politisch und wirtschaftlich deutlich ausbauen und auf ein neues level der zusammenarbeit heben.\n0.5927\n0.04478\n\n\nGRUENE\nwir treiben die un-dekade für menschen afrikanischer herkunft voran (z.\ndeshalb wollen wir die un-dekade für menschen afrikanischer herkunft vorantreiben.\n0.9701\n0.04478\n\n\nFDP\nwir wollen 30 prozent ökolandbau bis zum jahr 2030 erreichen.\nwir brauchen land- und forstwirtschaft, die nachhaltig ist und flächen, die zusätzliche beiträge zum naturschutz leisten.\n0.5922\n0.04361\n\n\nSPD\nwir wollen 30 prozent ökolandbau bis zum jahr 2030 erreichen.\ndementsprechend werden wir im einklang mit den europäischen klimazielen unser minderungsziel für 2030 deutlich (auf 65 %) anheben; auch für 2040 werden wir ein minderungsziel festschreiben (88 %).\n0.6347\n0.04361\n\n\nGRUENE\nwir wollen 30 prozent ökolandbau bis zum jahr 2030 erreichen.\nziel sind 30 prozent ökolandbau bis 2030.\n0.9732\n0.04361\n\n\nFDP\nmindestlohn wir werden den gesetzlichen mindestlohn in einer einmaligen anpassung auf zwölf euro pro stunde erhöhen.\ndie mindest- und maximalbeträge wollen wir erhöhen, auch als inflationsausgleich.\n0.5519\n0.03752\n\n\nSPD\nmindestlohn wir werden den gesetzlichen mindestlohn in einer einmaligen anpassung auf zwölf euro pro stunde erhöhen.\nwir werden den gesetzlichen mindestlohn zunächst auf mindestens zwölf euro erhöhen und die spielräume der mindestlohnkommission für künftige erhöhungen ausweiten.\n0.8980\n0.03752\n\n\nGRUENE\nmindestlohn wir werden den gesetzlichen mindestlohn in einer einmaligen anpassung auf zwölf euro pro stunde erhöhen.\nden gesetzlichen mindestlohn werden wir sofort auf 12 euro anheben.\n0.8756\n0.03752\n\n\n\nExcluding sentences shorter than 20 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Highest variance in scores\n\nclean_data |&gt; \n  group_by(sentence_coal) |&gt; \n  relocate(sentence_coal, .after = party) |&gt; \n  mutate(variance = var(score)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = variance, n = 7) |&gt; \n  gt::gt()|&gt; \n  gt::cols_label(\n    party = md(\"**Party**\"), \n    sentence_coal = md(\"*Coalition \\nAgreement*\"),\n    sentence = md(\"*Party \\nProgram*\"),\n    score = md(\"**Cosine \\nSimilarity**\"),\n    variance = md(\"**Variance**\"),\n  ) |&gt; \n  gt::tab_header(title = md(\"**Highest variance in scores**\"), subtitle = \"by variance of cosine similarity\") |&gt; \n  tab_footnote(md(\"*Excluding sentences shorter than 20 characters.*\"))|&gt;\n  tab_spanner(label = md(\"**Texts**\"), columns = c(\"sentence_coal\", \"sentence\")) |&gt; \n  gt_highlight_rows(rows = c(3,6), fill = paletteer::paletteer_d(\"lisa::FridaKahlo\")[2])|&gt; \n  gt_highlight_rows(rows = c(8), fill = paletteer::paletteer_d(\"lisa::FridaKahlo\")[5])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the sentences with the lowest variance, we would expect the estimation of perform even worse.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The replication problem\nWhen doing data analysis one of the problems we face is to make sure that our analysis is replicable. In a quantitative study, in which many of the outcomes are produced by code from pre-existing data, in theory, this should be easily achieved. However, the ongoing replication crisis in different scientific fields has shown to be rather durable. In the following I will address this topic with an example of Uppsala Conflict Data Center datasets. In Part I, only a broad overview of changes in their datasets will be provided, in Part II I want to explore those changes a bit more across regions.\nRetrospective changes\nWhile working with data, I have more often than not come across the issue that I download some dataset and work on the analysis. A few month go by where I work on other things and when getting back to the project I download the data again, except now the results have changed! This is very common in datasets in political science, where good data is hard to come by and new information might change how we code past events.\nOne case that I came across recently is conflict data, so information on how many conflicts take place in a given time frame and area and also how many fatalities are associated with these.\nThe Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), as they write themselves, is the world’s main provider of data on organized violence and the oldest ongoing data collection project for civil war, with a history of almost 40 years. Its definition of armed conflict has become the global standard of how conflicts are systematically defined and studied.\nUCDP offers us a nice insight into this problem, because they properly version their datasets, allowing us to retroactively access outdated datasets and even provide detailed codebooks for each different version and what has changed. See for example here.\n\n\nVersioning Example from UCDP\n\nSidenote: Code that is understandable, reproducable and hence helps to replicate\nWhen writing code that makes data available that I use frequently, I try to make my code reproducible. This is firstly to save myself work in the future, but it will also make it easier for others to use my code to replicate my results. One great way of doing this is to package code into an actual R-package. If you are interested in doing this, the single-most helpful and wonderful resource is this book here by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan.\nThe conflictoR package\nSpecifically with the resource above, I have found that the two packages which promised to allow access to the API in R where not fully functional for my use-case (either because they did not allow filtering and contributions in a private gitlab were complicated or because the package actually was not fully developed and seemed stale). Hence I quickly wrote my own code, which I then packaged, so I can use it again in the future and others can use it to access the same data.\nYou can find the conflictoR package on github and install it as follows:\n\nrequire(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"datapumpernickel/conflictoR\")\n\nVisualizing the UCDP conflict counts\nGetting and cleaning the data\nNow for starters, let’s replicate the graph that appears on the dashboard of UCDP for the number of conflicts in the world. For that we need three datasets, c(\"ucdpprioconflict\", \"nonstate\", \"onesided\").\n\nShow the query## loading libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(conflictoR)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n\n## making a dataframe with all combinations of datasets and versions\ndatasets  = c(\"ucdpprioconflict\", \"nonstate\", \"onesided\")\nversion &lt;- \"24.1\"\n\n## querying this data using the conflictoR package\nstate &lt;- cl_get_data(resource = datasets[1], \n                     version =  version) |&gt;\n  ## selecting the columns we need\n  transmute(\n    dataset = datasets[1],\n    year = as.character(year),\n    conflict_id,\n    version = \"24.1\"\n  ) \n\nnonstate &lt;- cl_get_data(resource = datasets[2], version =  version) |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    dataset = datasets[2],\n    year = as.character(year),\n    conflict_id,\n    version = \"24.1\"\n  ) \n\nonesided &lt;- cl_get_data(resource = datasets[3], version =  version) |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    dataset = datasets[3],\n    year = as.character(year),\n    conflict_id,\n    version = \"24.1\"\n  ) \n\n## clean the data to count actual conflicts and merge the sets\nclean_full_data &lt;- bind_rows(state,\n                             nonstate,\n                             onesided)|&gt;\n  count(year, version, dataset) |&gt; \n  group_by(year, dataset) |&gt; \n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\n\nWith the three datasets queried and cleaned, as well as having counted the unique conflict_ids per year, dataset and version, we can now move on to visualize the numbers.\n\n\nPlot\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Replication for UCDP official conflict count dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolors &lt;- c(\n  \"ucdpprioconflict\" = \"#D55E00\",    # red for State-Based Violence\n  \"nonstate\" = \"#009E73\",            # green for Non-State Violence\n  \"onesided\" = \"#F0E442\"             # yellow for One-Sided Violence\n)\n\nlabels &lt;- c(\n  \"ucdpprioconflict\" = \"State-Based Violence\",\n  \"nonstate\" = \"Non-State Violence\",\n  \"onesided\" = \"One-Sided Violence\"\n)\nclean_full_data &lt;- read_rds(\"data1.rds\")\n\n# Generate the plot\nggplot(data = clean_full_data |&gt; \n         filter(year &gt;= 1975 & year &lt;= 2023, version == \"24.1\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = n, color = dataset, group = dataset), size = 1) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = n, color = dataset), size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors, \n                     labels = labels) +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Conflicts\", subtitle = \"1975-2023\", caption = \"using version 24.1 of all datasets\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1975, 2023, 5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 20), limits = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey20\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"white\", size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"white\", size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"white\", size = 10),\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", color = NA)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nTracking changes across different versions\nNow in order to look at how these numbers change across different versions, lets get the datasets for all versions. The below code uses tidyr to expand our unique combinations of datasets and versions to one dataset. We then use the handy map2() function from the map() family of purrr to iterate over the two columns of the data. We could have also achieved this with pmap(), but map2() makes it a bit more explicit how the variables were passed on.\n\n## making a dataframe with all combinations of datasets and versions\nall_combinations  &lt;- tidyr::expand_grid(\n  datasets  = c(\"ucdpprioconflict\", \"nonstate\", \"onesided\"),\n  versions  = c(\"24.1\", \"23.1\", \"22.1\", \"21.1\", \"20.1\", \"17.2\", \"18.1\", \"19.1\")\n)\n\n## querying this data using the conflictoR package\nfull_data &lt;- map2(\n  all_combinations$datasets,\n  all_combinations$versions,\n  ~ cl_get_data(.x, .y) |&gt;\n    transmute(\n      dataset = .x,\n      year = as.character(year),\n      conflict_id,\n      version = .y\n    )\n)\n\nNow that we queried all the dataset-version combinations, we can bind the datasets together and actually count the conflicts in each year for each version and dataset. For each dataset-year combination, we also get the maximum and minimum count, to be able to plot this range as well.\n\n## clean the data to count actual conflicts\nclean_full_data &lt;- full_data |&gt;\n  reduce(bind_rows) |&gt;\n  count(year, version, dataset) |&gt; \n  group_by(year, dataset) |&gt; \n  mutate(n_max = max(n),\n         n_min = min(n)) |&gt; \n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\n\n\nPlot\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging counts of conflict episodes across different datasets and versions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## making a dataframe with all combinations of datasets and versions\nall_combinations  &lt;- tidyr::expand_grid(\n  datasets  = c(\"ucdpprioconflict\", \"nonstate\", \"onesided\"),\n  versions  = c(\"24.1\", \"23.1\", \"22.1\", \"21.1\", \"20.1\", \"17.2\", \"18.1\", \"19.1\")\n)\n\n## querying this data using the conflictoR package\nfull_data &lt;- map2(\n  all_combinations$datasets,\n  all_combinations$versions,\n  ~ cl_get_data(.x, .y) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      dataset = .x,\n      year = as.character(year),\n      conflict_id,\n      version = .y\n    )\n)\n\n## clean the data to count actual conflicts\nclean_full_data &lt;- full_data |&gt;\n  map( ~ .x |&gt; distinct(conflict_id, year, version, dataset)) |&gt;\n  reduce(bind_rows) |&gt;\n  count(year, version, dataset) |&gt; \n  group_by(year, dataset) |&gt; \n  mutate(n_max = max(n),\n         n_min = min(n)) |&gt; \n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\nggplot(data = clean_full_data |&gt; \n         filter(year %in% 2000:2024)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x = year, ymax = n_max, ymin = n_min), \n                fill = \"grey80\")+\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = n,group =version, color = version),\n             alpha = 0.7)+\n  labs(title = \"Changes in conflict counts\", subtitle =\"over different versions of yearly totals\")+\n  facet_wrap(.~dataset, ncol = 1)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2024, 2))+\n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes quite evident that not too seldomly the number of conflicts is changed from one version to another, even if the actual conflict is quite some years back! This should probably not come as a surprise, since areas of violent conflict are usually hard to gain access to and collecting information in this environment is dangerous and news articles about these incidents are probably often not accurate, until some time has passed to allow for thorough investigation. It speaks to the dedication of researchers at UCDP that they incorporate changes so far back into their datasets.\nThe fact that we can see the largest amount of changes in the last 10 years, might be due to the fact, that the API only allows us to query the last 7 versions dating back to 2017.\nOverestimation or Underestimation?\nIntuitively, one would assume that lack of information leads to a systematic underestimation of conflict data. Hence, one question I wanted to answer was: Are conflicts usually underestimated and then corrected upwards or are conflict periods also overestimated?\nTo answer this question, for each dataset I compared the changes between current and previous version and checked if the previous year-dataset-version triad was smaller than the current one or if there was no change at all.\n\nShow the code to clean and prepare the datachanges_analysis &lt;- clean_full_data |&gt; \n  group_by(dataset, year) |&gt; \n  arrange(dataset, year, version) |&gt; \n  mutate(lag_n = lag(n),\n         biased_downward = n&gt;lag_n,\n         perc_change = ((n/lag_n)-1)*100,\n         change = n!= lag_n) |&gt; \n  filter(change) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nI found 167 periods were data was corrected ex post. A majority, in total 153 of these were corrected upwards. In addition, we can see that more than half of these episodes experience a change of roundabout 2.5 - 5% change upwards, whereas there is some really stark outliers, where the number of conflicts changes by a staggering 20%.\n\n\nPlot\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection of change in corrections across different versions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(changes_analysis)+\n  geom_boxplot(aes(biased_downward, perc_change)) +\n    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color= \"#bd5b54\", alpha = 0.8)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n       x = \"\", \n       y = \"Change in % of original value\",\n       caption = \"Uppsala Conflict Data Program, ucdp.uu.se, version 17.2 through 24.1 of resources: 'onesided', 'ucdpprioconflict' and 'nonstate'\")+\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\",size = 7 ))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(changes_analysis |&gt; count(biased_downward))+\n  geom_col(aes(x = 1, y = n, group = biased_downward, fill = biased_downward), position = \"stack\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#e7a169\",\"#846e9a\"))+\n  labs(title = \"Corrections in percent of original value\", \n       subtitle = \"by directional change\", fill = \"Counts were corrected upwards\")\n\np2 / p1 + plot_layout(heights = c(1,5))\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe saw that it is quite easy to provide some interesting insights into how conflict episodes changed retrospectively, but this was only so straight forward, because UCDP on the one hand provides an API for easy access to their data and secondly, very meticulously versions different versions of their dataset. The takeaway from this hence should be:\n\nbe careful when interpreting this data, you might be underestimating conflict episodes by a few percent across the board\n\nand\n\nalways make sure you make transparent which version of a dataset you are using, so others can replicate your analysis (and of course attribute the source).\n\nThis seems straight forward, but large data providers, such as one of the single most important sources for Trade Data, UN Comtrade, do not version their datasets in this way and you might never be able to replicate your analysis, if you did not make a snapshot of the data by yourself and share it with others.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDavies, Shawn, Garoun Engström, Therese Pettersson, and Magnus Öberg. 2024. “Organized Violence 1989-2023, and the Prevalence of Organized Crime Groups.” Journal of Peace Research 61 (4).\n\n\nEck, Kristine, and Lisa Hultman. 2007. “Violence Against Civilians in War.” Journal of Peace Research 44 (2).\n\n\nGleditsch, Nils Petter, Peter Wallensteen, Mikael Eriksson, Margareta Sollenberg, and Håvard Strand. 2002. “Armed Conflict 1946-2001: A New Dataset.” Journal of Peace Research 39 (5).\n\n\nSundberg, Ralph, Kristine Eck, and Joakim Kreutz. 2012. “Introducing the UCDP Non-State Conflict Dataset.” Journal of Peace Research 49 (2).\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochtler2024,\n  author = {Bochtler, Paul},\n  title = {Part {I:} {Visualizing} Changes Across Versions of Conflict\n    Data from {UCDP}},\n  date = {2024-11-08},\n  url = {https://www.paulbochtler.de/blog/2024/02/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochtler, Paul. 2024. “Part I: Visualizing Changes Across Versions\nof Conflict Data from UCDP.” November 8, 2024. https://www.paulbochtler.de/blog/2024/02/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of this data collection is to examine the output of the European Union (EU) in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since the entry into force of the Lis- bon Treaty in 2009. To date, European academic research has been lacking a comprehen- sive quantitative record of CFSP output. Individual data sets, such as on the sanctions im- posed by the EU, are an exception and already well documented and analysed in detail. However, a documentation of the CFSP, such as published by the German Federal Foreign Office in the 1990s, has been discontinued. The unique feature of this analysis is there- fore the ambition to systematically collect all public data on various areas of the CFSP. The intergovernmental nature of the CFSP is distinct from other communitarised EU policies. Member states are bound by the principle of unanimity unless there are clearly defined exceptions. Decision-making in the Council of the EU takes place largely behind closed doors and in the non-legislative area. The issues discussed in the European Council or the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) are confidential and often classified. The CFSP falls within the sphere of national security and executive ownership, where secrecy is tolerated as a necessity for government executive action. This “functional” secrecy may well open up new negotiating spaces for diplomatic successes. Trust forms the basis for negotia- tions at the EU level and is created through personal exchanges between representatives of the member states. The EU’s multi-level system reinforces the requirements of confi- dentiality in the CFSP, as it is not only the sum of national foreign and security policies, but also creates its own dynamics of confidentiality at the EU level.\nSecrecy stands in a complicated relation to transparency, which the EU has committed itself to in the Lisbon Treaty. Documents are published in almost unmanageable numbers - the Council claims to make some 25 000 documents available to the public every year. However, the amount of data is insufficiently processed and it is left to the users to sys- tematise it. This makes a quantitative analysis of the CFSP as a separate policy area con- siderably more difficult. Moreover, despite the transparency requirement, a number of CFSP-relevant documents are still kept under lock and key due to the confidentiality of the policy area. Functional secrecy in diplomacy may be necessary to a certain extent for the functioning of foreign policy, but it ought to be accompanied by functional transparency of policy results. In order to locate political responsibility, more than the mere publication ofunprocessed data is needed. Low-threshold access for users to the information contained in documents is essential for functional transparency; for example, through machine-read- able formatting and user-friendly filter functions.\nGiven the current data availability, research is dependent on close cooperation with the EU Council Secretariat in order to obtain systematic access to data for a quantitative anal- ysis of the CFSP. A further complicating factor is that EU documents that are relevant for research do not automatically have to be published and released by the responsible au- thorities. The final decision on publication remains with the EU decision-makers, who have a gatekeeper function. The information that the EU provides, for example through its website, is therefore inevitably incomplete and only represents a selection. The contents of the press releases of the European External Action Service (EEAS), which in principle are easily accessible sources of information, are also carefully selected. The present data collection and output analysis of the CFSP based on it are therefore limited by default. In a first step, the methodological approach to data collection chosen here is presented. SPARQL queries were used as well as an automated collection of raw data by means of web scraping of the Council websites. In a subsequent step, a descriptive analysis of the data on CFSP output follows. Council decisions, sanctions and minutes of Council meetings as well as press releases are examined. The pilot study on CFSP output carried out here makes it possible to formulate recommendations for improved functional transparency, which is a necessary step for further research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Do autocracies cooperate internationally? This working paper investigates whether regime-type explains co-sponsorship patterns at the United Nations General Assembly. Co-sponsorship is a relatively costly signal of international cooperation at the UN, which is analyzed based on a novel dataset, including newly validated issue categories and co-sponsorship behavior on 14.995 draft resolutions. Theoretically, the paper unifies three strands of literature: the recent literature on autocratic regional organizations, the growing literature on foreign policy of autocratic regimes and the traditional analysis of the United Nations. The results suggest that regime-type plays a strong role in co-sponsorship behavior: democracies co-sponsor with their peers, whereas autocracies, in line with existing findings, cooperate overall less at the UN. They do, however, prefer to co-sponsor with one another over partners of other regime-types. This seems to be particularly true in issue areas where autocratic regimes could attempt to counter democratic norm-setting, such as human rights. There is mixed results concerning the effect of autocratic regional organizations on autocratic co-sponsorship. Preliminary results suggest at least some positive effect on autocracies and highlight the need for further research."

However, for autocratic states, there is a slight increase in the likelihood of cooperation.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Average Marginal Effect of the Co-membership type of a dyad, over different values of dyad regime types. The confidence intervals were obtained from 100 bootstrapped samples with replacement of the full Model 6 in 6 and show 90% of the samples in the distribution. In the plot reported are also the absolute occurences of each combination of co-variates."

Did these pattern change during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the Council had to resort to video meetings? To answer these questions, a new dataset of public data from the EU was cleaned for easy access and analysis.

The period of qualitative research and data collection was from 1.1.2020 to 31.1.2024. The project was designed to be exploratory. The central research question that emerged was how decision-makers in the three Maghreb states of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia attempt to influence attitudes and discourses on Israel and Iran and use them for domestic and foreign policy purposes. Further, subordinate research questions can be derived from this: How are Israel and Iran portrayed in official discourses and sources? What public moods and resonance does the respective state control encounter? Where does it reach its limits and what domestic and foreign policy risks are associated with the instrumentalization of Israel and/or Iran? To this end, texts from the news agencies of Algeria and Morocco were collected, coded and analyzed for the official framing. Arabic language Twitter data was collected and analyzed in order to depict public and political moods. Qualitative interviews were conducted, Facebook pages were qualitatively evaluated and opinion polls from the region were used for a comparison. These qualitative analysis are not included in the data set."

Most research on military expenditure relies on their yearly updates.\nWhen working with their data, I realised that the xlsx files they provide are sometimes a little complicated to parse, because they include information in footnotes, as well as additional columns and rows that are not read in properly by the classic functions for reading in excel files.\n\n\nExcel file that can be downloaded on the website\n\nHence, when parsing this file for the first time, I thought it would be handy to have a package for R, that queries their database, downloads the excel file and directly parses it nicely into the classic format for R, a tibble().\nInstalling milRex\nThe resulting package, milRex is currently not on CRAN, because the submission process is somewhat of a hussle and it is quite straight-forward to install adn then load it from github.

However, the iso codes by SIPRI often do not match the official ISO codes, we will see below.\nAs we can see from the glimpse above, some of the data is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for missing data\n\n\nin the SIPRI database\n\n\nSpecified Reason\n# missing\n\n\n\n\ncountry did not exist or was independent\n235\n\n\ndata unavailable\n4628\n\n\n\nSource: Information from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Military Expenditure Database, https://doi.org/10.55163/CQGC9685.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, most missings are there, because the data is simply not available, whereas some are originating from countries that simply did not exist at the time. The database dates military expenditure back to 1945.\nPlotting Data\nFor starters, lets try to replicate the yearly graph that SIPRI published about overall military expenditure in constant USD. At SIPRI it looks like this:\n\n\nOriginal Graph in the yearly publication by SIPRI\n\nWe need to aggregate data by regions, which is easily done with a dataset included in the package, that contains the regions with machted country codes.\nWe need a few libraries for that, which we will load, afterwards we join the region names to our data, we then sum up the values, excluding the missing values. We also limit the data to years after 1988 and exclude the year 1991, as recommended by SIPRI. Afterwards we format the date column to a nice yearly date for the plot.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n## \n## Attaching package: 'lubridate'\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n## \n##     date, intersect, setdiff, union\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nmilex_regional &lt;- milex |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(milRex::sipri_regions) |&gt;  ## join data\n  dplyr::summarise(value = sum(value, na.rm = T), \n                   .by = c(region, year)) |&gt; ## sum up \n  dplyr::filter(year &gt;= 1988)|&gt; ## exclude values pre-1988\n  dplyr::mutate(value = if_else(year == 1991, 0, value)) |&gt; # exclude 1991\n  dplyr::mutate(year = paste(year, \"01-01\") |&gt; \n                  lubridate::ymd()) # format dates nicely \n## Joining with `by = join_by(country)`\n\nNow we can plot this, by using ggplot2.

Here we use a few more packages to match the actual country codes to their geo-spatial files.\nWe also use a bounding box (bbox), to crop the geo-spatial files, so we don´t plot some French islands in the Atlantic ocean.\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(giscoR)\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\n## this gets us a vector of iso3codes for EU countries\neu_countries &lt;- giscoR::gisco_countrycode |&gt; dplyr::filter(eu) |&gt; dplyr::pull(ISO3_CODE)\n\n## this is a bounding box, figuring out the limits can be a bit tricky\n## there is a pretty good tutorial on this here: https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2019/04/30/zooming-in-on-maps-with-sf-and-ggplot2/ \nbounds &lt;- st_bbox(c(xmin = -20, xmax = 35, ymin = 34, ymax = 70))\n\n### giscoR lets us get the official shape files used by Eurostat\neu_map &lt;- giscoR::gisco_get_countries() |&gt; dplyr::filter(ISO3_CODE %in% eu_countries) |&gt; sf::st_crop(bounds)\n\n## lets get them also for other countries for a nice backdrop\nworld_map &lt;- giscoR::gisco_get_countries() |&gt; sf::st_crop(bounds)\n\n## now we get the sipri data\neu_share_gdp &lt;- sipri_get_data(indicator = \"shareOfGDP\") |&gt; \n  ## next we transform the country cdoes to actual iso codes (e.g. SIPRI uses AST for Austria...)\n  dplyr::mutate(iso3c = countrycode::countrycode(country, origin = \"country.name.en\", destination = \"iso3c\")) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(iso3c %in% eu_countries) |&gt; \n  ## restrict to EU countries and the last available year\n  dplyr::filter(year == max(year)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(eu_map, by = c(\"iso3c\" = \"ISO3_CODE\")) |&gt; \n  sf::st_as_sf()\n\nIt becomes quite clear, how the countries bordering or close to Russia dedicate a much higher share of their GDP to defence. In addition, of course Greece, which has high geopolitical tensions with Turkey spends a high share.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(grid)  # For using inset layout\n\nggplot(eu_share_gdp) +\n  geom_sf(data = world_map, fill = \"grey60\") +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = value * 100)) +\n  theme_void() +  \n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = rgb(215, 229, 221, maxColorValue = 255)),\n    legend.background = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"inside\",\n    legend.position.inside = c(0.1, 0.3),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.key.size = unit(0.3, 'in'),\n    title = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(\n      t = -10,\n      r = -1,\n      b = -1,\n      l = -1\n    )  \n  ) +\n  coord_sf(expand = FALSE, ylim = c(34, 65)) + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = rgb(100, 156, 136, maxColorValue = 255),\n    mid = \"white\",\n    midpoint = 2,\n    high = rgb(118, 40, 116, maxColorValue = 255)\n  ) +\n  labs(fill = \"% of GDP\") +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"label\",\n    x = -10,\n    y = 60,\n    label = \"Military Expenditure \\n as share of GDP in 2023\",\n    fill = \"grey10\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    label.size = NA\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"label\",\n    x = 7.8,\n    y = 34.3,\n    label = \"  Source: Information from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Military Expenditure Database, https://doi.org/10.55163/CQGC9685.            \",\n    size = 2,\n    fill = \"white\",\n    color = \"grey10\",\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    label.size = NA\n  )\n\n\n\nShare of Money spent on military expenditure as share of GDP\n\n\n\nThis becomes even clearer, if we check whether countries reach the spending target of 2% of GDP by the NATO.\n\n\n\n\nNATO Spending target reached\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bochtler2024,\n  author = {Bochtler, Paul},\n  title = {Military {Expenditure} {Data} from {SIPRI}},\n  date = {2024-09-20},\n  url = {https://www.paulbochtler.de/blog/2024/01/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBochtler, Paul. 2024. “Military Expenditure Data from\nSIPRI.” September 20, 2024. https://www.paulbochtler.de/blog/2024/01/."
