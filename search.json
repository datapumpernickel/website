    "text": "My R packages are mostly a collection of data querying and processing tools that I use frequently and hence have packaged to make my life (and hopefully that of others) in the future easier.\n\n\n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    comtradr\n    comtradr is the interface to the United\nNations Comtrade API . Comtrade provides\ncountry level shipping data for a variety of commodities, these\nfunctions allow for easy API query and data returned as a tidy data\nframe. You need a (free) API key from the UN. Maintained in the rOpenSci Universe.\n  \n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    comRex\n    comRex provides a wrapper for the Eurostat SDMX API, focusing on the Comext trade database. It allows for easy querying of EU trade data from 2002 onwards by various classification levels (HS2, HS4, HS6, CN8).\n  \n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    milRex\n    milRex allows users to query military expenditure data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). It simplifies accessing up-to-date global military spending data and formatting it for analysis.\n  \n  \n  \n     \n       \n         \n    Rat.las\n    Ratlas makes it easy to query the data of the  \n    Atlas of Economic Complexity. \n    You need an API key for the Harvard Dataverse.\n    \n  \n  \n  \n       \n       \n         \n     EU Council Monitor\n     The EU Council Monitor is not a package, but a dashboard I wrote, which I usually use as a template, because it is modularized and lends itself to easy extension for simple visualizations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "European actors are increasingly relying on strategic communication tools in their external relations, especially in key partner countries like Kenya. Based on a large-scale media screening and interviews with media experts, this paper examines which issues related to the EU/Europe and China have received the most media coverage in Kenya over the past decade (2013–2023). The paper finds, among other things, that European actors involved in communication efforts increasingly need to communicate about the EU’s role in global affairs and the impact of European decisions, products, and standards on African markets, without resorting to a “West versus China” framing."

The period of qualitative research and data collection was from 1.1.2020 to 31.1.2024. The project was designed to be exploratory. The central research question that emerged was how decision-makers in the three Maghreb states of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia attempt to influence attitudes and discourses on Israel and Iran and use them for domestic and foreign policy purposes. Further, subordinate research questions can be derived from this: How are Israel and Iran portrayed in official discourses and sources? What public moods and resonance does the respective state control encounter? Where does it reach its limits and what domestic and foreign policy risks are associated with the instrumentalization of Israel and/or Iran? To this end, texts from the news agencies of Algeria and Morocco were collected, coded and analyzed for the official framing. Arabic language Twitter data was collected and analyzed in order to depict public and political moods. Qualitative interviews were conducted, Facebook pages were qualitatively evaluated and opinion polls from the region were used for a comparison. These qualitative analysis are not included in the data set."

Particular attention was given to the following issues: How often did the Council adopt decision by consensus despite voting under qualified majority? Which member states are most often outvoted? Did these pattern change during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the Council had to resort to video meetings? To answer these questions, a new dataset of public data from the EU was cleaned for easy access and analysis. This dataset encompasses all voting data from the public votes in the Council of the EU from January 2010 to March 2023. Due to the rules of procedure of the Council of the EU, only legislative votes are made public. The collected data therefore necessarily encompasses only a limited, self-selected number from all votes in the Council. As of April 12 2023, 1.397 votes are available."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Do autocracies cooperate internationally? This working paper investigates whether regime-type explains co-sponsorship patterns at the United Nations General Assembly. Co-sponsorship is a relatively costly signal of international cooperation at the UN, which is analyzed based on a novel dataset, including newly validated issue categories and co-sponsorship behavior on 14.995 draft resolutions. Theoretically, the paper unifies three strands of literature: the recent literature on autocratic regional organizations, the growing literature on foreign policy of autocratic regimes and the traditional analysis of the United Nations. The results suggest that regime-type plays a strong role in co-sponsorship behavior: democracies co-sponsor with their peers, whereas autocracies, in line with existing findings, cooperate overall less at the UN. They do, however, prefer to co-sponsor with one another over partners of other regime-types. This seems to be particularly true in issue areas where autocratic regimes could attempt to counter democratic norm-setting, such as human rights. There is mixed results concerning the effect of autocratic regional organizations on autocratic co-sponsorship. Preliminary results suggest at least some positive effect on autocracies and highlight the need for further research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Traditionally falling under the remit of the World Health Organization (WHO), health issues such as health emergencies or access to healthcare have been addressed more frequently in debates and resolutions of the UN Security Council (UNSC) since 2000. As the UNSC is the UN’s principal body dealing with threats and endangerments to international peace and security, this points to a certain degree of the securitisation of health. By means of a statistical analysis of UNSC speeches between 1995 and 2019 as well as by examining health-related UNSC resolutions, this research explores by whom and how health is treated as a security issue in UNSC debates. This article argues that health is increasingly paid attention to during health emergencies, displaying a narrow framing of health that follows a health security paradigm. However, health is also addressed with a focus on health systems, the wider determinants of health as well as with respect to the access to healthcare and hospitals and the protection of healthcare personnel. This points to the UNSC considering a broader understanding of public health issues to be relevant for its security agenda."

    "text": "The project “Interconnectors and Power Transmission Lines” was realised within the framework of the SWP Research Paper “Geopolitik des Stroms – Netz, Raum und Macht” (SWP-Studie 2021/S 14, 07.09.2021) and had the objective of identifying and visualising all interconnecting power lines in Europe, Africa and Asia regardless of their primary source of energy that are of relevance on the transmission grid level. As of 2020, no comprehensive data or database on transmission lines and interconnectors were available. Hence, this dataset contributes to filling this gap. It comprises merged and harmonised data from three different sources, namely from the OpenStreetMap (OSM, https://www.openstreetmap.org), the Open Infrastructure Map (OIM, https://openinframap.org), and the World Bank (WB, https://energydata.info), complemented by further research, including the updating and adding of information."

    "title": "A Critical Perspective on Data Transparency in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union: Methodological Challenges in Foreign Policy Research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of this data collection is to examine the output of the European Union (EU) in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since the entry into force of the Lis- bon Treaty in 2009. To date, European academic research has been lacking a comprehen- sive quantitative record of CFSP output. Individual data sets, such as on the sanctions im- posed by the EU, are an exception and already well documented and analysed in detail. However, a documentation of the CFSP, such as published by the German Federal Foreign Office in the 1990s, has been discontinued. The unique feature of this analysis is there- fore the ambition to systematically collect all public data on various areas of the CFSP. The intergovernmental nature of the CFSP is distinct from other communitarised EU policies. Member states are bound by the principle of unanimity unless there are clearly defined exceptions. Decision-making in the Council of the EU takes place largely behind closed doors and in the non-legislative area. The issues discussed in the European Council or the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) are confidential and often classified. The CFSP falls within the sphere of national security and executive ownership, where secrecy is tolerated as a necessity for government executive action. This “functional” secrecy may well open up new negotiating spaces for diplomatic successes. Trust forms the basis for negotia- tions at the EU level and is created through personal exchanges between representatives of the member states. The EU’s multi-level system reinforces the requirements of confi- dentiality in the CFSP, as it is not only the sum of national foreign and security policies, but also creates its own dynamics of confidentiality at the EU level.\nSecrecy stands in a complicated relation to transparency, which the EU has committed itself to in the Lisbon Treaty. Documents are published in almost unmanageable numbers - the Council claims to make some 25 000 documents available to the public every year. However, the amount of data is insufficiently processed and it is left to the users to sys- tematise it. This makes a quantitative analysis of the CFSP as a separate policy area con- siderably more difficult. Moreover, despite the transparency requirement, a number of CFSP-relevant documents are still kept under lock and key due to the confidentiality of the policy area. Functional secrecy in diplomacy may be necessary to a certain extent for the functioning of foreign policy, but it ought to be accompanied by functional transparency of policy results. In order to locate political responsibility, more than the mere publication ofunprocessed data is needed. Low-threshold access for users to the information contained in documents is essential for functional transparency; for example, through machine-read- able formatting and user-friendly filter functions.\nGiven the current data availability, research is dependent on close cooperation with the EU Council Secretariat in order to obtain systematic access to data for a quantitative anal- ysis of the CFSP. A further complicating factor is that EU documents that are relevant for research do not automatically have to be published and released by the responsible au- thorities. The final decision on publication remains with the EU decision-makers, who have a gatekeeper function. The information that the EU provides, for example through its website, is therefore inevitably incomplete and only represents a selection. The contents of the press releases of the European External Action Service (EEAS), which in principle are easily accessible sources of information, are also carefully selected. The present data collection and output analysis of the CFSP based on it are therefore limited by default. In a first step, the methodological approach to data collection chosen here is presented. SPARQL queries were used as well as an automated collection of raw data by means of web scraping of the Council websites. In a subsequent step, a descriptive analysis of the data on CFSP output follows. Council decisions, sanctions and minutes of Council meetings as well as press releases are examined. The pilot study on CFSP output carried out here makes it possible to formulate recommendations for improved functional transparency, which is a necessary step for further research."

    "text": "At the beginning of July 2020, a series of detonations in the Iranian nuclear fuel enrich- ment plant in Natanz triggered fears of a Stuxnet 2.0.1 The Stuxnet computer worm, which physically destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in 2010, is considered by many as the starting point for the smoldering cyber conflict between Iran and the USA.2 Stuxnet is still considered to be one of the most aggressive cyber attacks to date because it was the first digital malware to cause damage in physical space, thus reaching a new level of intensity. In the words of former NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden, “someone crossed the Rubicon” with Stuxnet.3\nThe conflict dyad USA-Iran is particularly interesting from the perspective of cyber secu- rity research and international relations since disputes are carried out in the cyber- and information space as well as in the conventional, physical domain. The interaction be- tween the two cyber powers has a “cross-domain” dimension, which has been rarely stud- ied so far.\nSince 2018, the USA has a new cyber security policy of “persistent engagement” that some regard as potentially escalating.4 In addition, the conflict escalated in early 2020 as a con- sequence of the targeted killing of Iranian General Soleimani in January. In view of the US presidential elections in 2020, many security experts expected costly and destructive cyber retaliatory strikes by Iran as the Islamic Republic is now considered a serious cyber power that does not shy away from aggressive, destructive attacks. Since Iran has shown interest in targeting critical infrastructures in the US, a potentially damaging retaliatory cyber attack cannot be ruled out completely.5 The likelihood of a destructive cyber retalia- tion in response to a conventional attack is uncertain and research on escalation dynamics in cyberspace and across domains is still in its infancy."
