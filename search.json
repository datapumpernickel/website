    "text": "SIPRI data\nData from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute is the only source on military expenditure that is entirely open source. Most research on military expenditure relies on their yearly updates.\nWhen working with their data, I realised that the xlsx files they provide are sometimes a little complicated to parse, because they include information in footnotes, as well as additional columns and rows that are not read in properly by the classic functions for reading in excel files.\n\n\nExcel file that can be downloaded on the website\n\nHence, when parsing this file for the first time, I thought it would be handy to have a package for R, that queries their database, downloads the excel file and directly parses it nicely into the classic format for R, a tibble().\nInstalling milRex\nThe resulting package, milRex is currently not on CRAN, because the submission process is somewhat of a hussle and it is quite straight-forward to install adn then load it from github. For that you need the package devtools.\n\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"datapumpernickel/milRex\")\nlibrary(milRex)\n\nNow you have access to the following indicators from the package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Indicators\n\n\nin the SIPRI database\n\n\nDescription\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nConstant (2022) US$\nconstantUSD\n\n\nCurrent US$\ncurrentUSD\n\n\nShare of GDP\nshareOfGDP\n\n\nShare of Govt. spending\nshareGovt\n\n\nRegional totals\nregionalTotals\n\n\nLocal currency financial years\ncurrencyFY\n\n\nLocal currency calendar years\ncurrencyCY\n\n\nPer capita\nperCapita\n\n\nall of the above\nall\n\n\n\nSource: Information from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Military Expenditure Database, https://doi.org/10.55163/CQGC9685.\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting data\nActually downloading the data is quite straight-forward, just do:\n\nmilex &lt;- sipri_get_data(indicator = \"constantUSD\")\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nglimpse(milex)\n## Rows: 13,050\n## Columns: 6\n## $ sheet   &lt;chr&gt; \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Constant (2022) US$\", \"Const…\n## $ country &lt;chr&gt; \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeri…\n## $ iso3c   &lt;chr&gt; \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"ALG\", \"A…\n## $ year    &lt;chr&gt; \"1949\", \"1950\", \"1951\", \"1952\", \"1953\", \"1954\", \"1955\", \"1956\", \"1957\", \"1958\", \"1959\", \"1960\", \"1961\", \"1962\", \"1963\", \"1964\", \"1965\", \"1966\", \"1967\", \"1968\", \"1969\", \"1970\", \"1971\", \"1972\", \"1973\", \"1974\", \"1975\", \"1976\", \"1977\", \"1978\", \"1979\", \"1980\", \"1981\", \"1982\", \"1983\", \"1…\n## $ value   &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 243.71, 227.69, 223.22, 216.05, 223.86, 429.15, 478.36, 666.69, 581.81, 630.25, 623.36, 709.02, 630.17, 727.57, 731.34, 686.81, 643.40, 633.13, 645.42, 638.69, 624.28, 666.89, 682.73, 1142.43, 1228.38, …\n## $ missing &lt;chr&gt; \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"data unavailable\", \"d…\n\nLooking at the data, it becomes apparent, that there is a few columns that are returned, we know the indicator we downloaded, the country name, as well as supposed iso codes and values, as well as a column for missing. However, the iso codes by SIPRI often do not match the official ISO codes, we will see below.\nAs we can see from the glimpse above, some of the data is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for missing data\n\n\nin the SIPRI database\n\n\nSpecified Reason\n# missing\n\n\n\n\ncountry did not exist or was independent\n235\n\n\ndata unavailable\n4628\n\n\n\nSource: Information from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Military Expenditure Database, https://doi.org/10.55163/CQGC9685.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, most missings are there, because the data is simply not available, whereas some are originating from countries that simply did not exist at the time. The database dates military expenditure back to 1945.\nPlotting Data\nFor starters, lets try to replicate the yearly graph that SIPRI published about overall military expenditure in constant USD. At SIPRI it looks like this:\n\n\nOriginal Graph in the yearly publication by SIPRI\n\nWe need to aggregate data by regions, which is easily done with a dataset included in the package, that contains the regions with machted country codes.\nWe need a few libraries for that, which we will load, afterwards we join the region names to our data, we then sum up the values, excluding the missing values. We also limit the data to years after 1988 and exclude the year 1991, as recommended by SIPRI. Afterwards we format the date column to a nice yearly date for the plot.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n## \n## Attaching package: 'lubridate'\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n## \n##     date, intersect, setdiff, union\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nmilex_regional &lt;- milex |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(milRex::sipri_regions) |&gt;  ## join data\n  dplyr::summarise(value = sum(value, na.rm = T), \n                   .by = c(region, year)) |&gt; ## sum up \n  dplyr::filter(year &gt;= 1988)|&gt; ## exclude values pre-1988\n  dplyr::mutate(value = if_else(year == 1991, 0, value)) |&gt; # exclude 1991\n  dplyr::mutate(year = paste(year, \"01-01\") |&gt; \n                  lubridate::ymd()) # format dates nicely \n## Joining with `by = join_by(country, iso3c)`\n\nNow we can plot this, by using ggplot2. However, the resulting plot, without any further formatting does not look too nice.\n\nggplot2::ggplot(milex_regional) +\n  ggplot2::geom_col(ggplot2::aes(year, value/1000, \n                                 fill = reorder(region, value)))\n\n\n\nThis is a bare-bones replication, but does not look nice.\n\n\n\nWhen we apply some additional formatting we get pretty far in approximating the SIPRI plot!\n\nggplot(milex_regional) +\n  geom_col(aes(year, value/1000, fill = reorder(region, value))) +\n  labs(y = \"Militarxy expenditure\\n (constant 2022 USD billion)\",\n       caption = \"1991 not present because no values for Soviet Union.\\n See https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2404_fs_milex_2023.pdf\", \n       fill = \"Region\",\n       x = \"\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = rgb(215, 229, 221, \n                                                  maxColorValue = 255)),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = rgb(215, 229, 221, \n                                                  maxColorValue = 255)),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill = rgb(215, 229, 221, \n                                                  maxColorValue = 255)),\n        legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 6,face  = \"bold\"),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        axis.line.x = element_line(),\n        text = element_text(size = 9),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.05, 'in'))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = \n                      c(\n                        rgb(83,50,82, maxColorValue = 255),\n                        rgb(118,81,116, maxColorValue = 255),\n                        rgb(186,144,177, maxColorValue = 255),\n                        rgb(154,173,164, maxColorValue = 255),\n                        rgb(100,156,136, maxColorValue = 255)\n                      ))+\n  scale_x_date(breaks = \"4 years\",date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,2500,500), limit = c(0, 2500), expand = c(0,0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Nicer version with additional formatting\n\n\n\n\nLets do a map of EU countries and their respective share of GDP they spend on defence. Here we use a few more packages to match the actual country codes to their geo-spatial files.\nWe also use a bounding box (bbox), to crop the geo-spatial files, so we don´t plot some French islands in the global south.\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(giscoR)\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\neu_countries &lt;- giscoR::gisco_countrycode |&gt; dplyr::filter(eu) |&gt; dplyr::pull(ISO3_CODE)\nbounds &lt;- st_bbox(c(xmin = -20, xmax = 35, ymin = 34, ymax = 70))\n\neu_map &lt;- giscoR::gisco_get_countries() |&gt; dplyr::filter(ISO3_CODE %in% eu_countries) |&gt; sf::st_crop(bounds)\nworld_map &lt;- giscoR::gisco_get_countries() |&gt; sf::st_crop(bounds)\n\n\neu_share_gdp &lt;- sipri_get_data(indicator = \"shareOfGDP\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(iso3c = countrycode::countrycode(country, origin = \"country.name.en\", destination = \"iso3c\")) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(iso3c %in% eu_countries) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2023) |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(eu_map, by = c(\"iso3c\" = \"ISO3_CODE\")) |&gt; \n  sf::st_as_sf()\n\nIt becomes quite clear, how the countries bordering or close to Russia dedicate a much higher share of their GDP to defence.

    "title": "A Critical Perspective on Data Transparency in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union: Methodological Challenges in Foreign Policy Research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of this data collection is to examine the output of the European Union (EU) in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since the entry into force of the Lis- bon Treaty in 2009. To date, European academic research has been lacking a comprehen- sive quantitative record of CFSP output. Individual data sets, such as on the sanctions im- posed by the EU, are an exception and already well documented and analysed in detail. However, a documentation of the CFSP, such as published by the German Federal Foreign Office in the 1990s, has been discontinued. The unique feature of this analysis is there- fore the ambition to systematically collect all public data on various areas of the CFSP. The intergovernmental nature of the CFSP is distinct from other communitarised EU policies. Member states are bound by the principle of unanimity unless there are clearly defined exceptions. Decision-making in the Council of the EU takes place largely behind closed doors and in the non-legislative area. The issues discussed in the European Council or the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) are confidential and often classified. The CFSP falls within the sphere of national security and executive ownership, where secrecy is tolerated as a necessity for government executive action. This “functional” secrecy may well open up new negotiating spaces for diplomatic successes. Trust forms the basis for negotia- tions at the EU level and is created through personal exchanges between representatives of the member states. The EU’s multi-level system reinforces the requirements of confi- dentiality in the CFSP, as it is not only the sum of national foreign and security policies, but also creates its own dynamics of confidentiality at the EU level.\nSecrecy stands in a complicated relation to transparency, which the EU has committed itself to in the Lisbon Treaty. Documents are published in almost unmanageable numbers - the Council claims to make some 25 000 documents available to the public every year. However, the amount of data is insufficiently processed and it is left to the users to sys- tematise it. This makes a quantitative analysis of the CFSP as a separate policy area con- siderably more difficult. Moreover, despite the transparency requirement, a number of CFSP-relevant documents are still kept under lock and key due to the confidentiality of the policy area. Functional secrecy in diplomacy may be necessary to a certain extent for the functioning of foreign policy, but it ought to be accompanied by functional transparency of policy results. In order to locate political responsibility, more than the mere publication ofunprocessed data is needed.

    "title": "A Critical Perspective on Data Transparency in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union: Methodological Challenges in Foreign Policy Research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of this data collection is to examine the output of the European Union (EU) in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since the entry into force of the Lis- bon Treaty in 2009. To date, European academic research has been lacking a comprehen- sive quantitative record of CFSP output. Individual data sets, such as on the sanctions im- posed by the EU, are an exception and already well documented and analysed in detail. However, a documentation of the CFSP, such as published by the German Federal Foreign Office in the 1990s, has been discontinued. The unique feature of this analysis is there- fore the ambition to systematically collect all public data on various areas of the CFSP. The intergovernmental nature of the CFSP is distinct from other communitarised EU policies. Member states are bound by the principle of unanimity unless there are clearly defined exceptions. Decision-making in the Council of the EU takes place largely behind closed doors and in the non-legislative area. The issues discussed in the European Council or the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) are confidential and often classified. The CFSP falls within the sphere of national security and executive ownership, where secrecy is tolerated as a necessity for government executive action. This “functional” secrecy may well open up new negotiating spaces for diplomatic successes. Trust forms the basis for negotia- tions at the EU level and is created through personal exchanges between representatives of the member states. The EU’s multi-level system reinforces the requirements of confi- dentiality in the CFSP, as it is not only the sum of national foreign and security policies, but also creates its own dynamics of confidentiality at the EU level.\nSecrecy stands in a complicated relation to transparency, which the EU has committed itself to in the Lisbon Treaty. Documents are published in almost unmanageable numbers - the Council claims to make some 25 000 documents available to the public every year. However, the amount of data is insufficiently processed and it is left to the users to sys- tematise it. This makes a quantitative analysis of the CFSP as a separate policy area con- siderably more difficult. Moreover, despite the transparency requirement, a number of CFSP-relevant documents are still kept under lock and key due to the confidentiality of the policy area. Functional secrecy in diplomacy may be necessary to a certain extent for the functioning of foreign policy, but it ought to be accompanied by functional transparency of policy results. In order to locate political responsibility, more than the mere publication ofunprocessed data is needed. Low-threshold access for users to the information contained in documents is essential for functional transparency; for example, through machine-read- able formatting and user-friendly filter functions.\nGiven the current data availability, research is dependent on close cooperation with the EU Council Secretariat in order to obtain systematic access to data for a quantitative anal- ysis of the CFSP. A further complicating factor is that EU documents that are relevant for research do not automatically have to be published and released by the responsible au- thorities.

Co-sponsorship is a relatively costly signal of international cooperation at the UN, which is analyzed based on a novel dataset, including newly validated issue categories and co-sponsorship behavior on 14.995 draft resolutions. Theoretically, the paper unifies three strands of literature: the recent literature on autocratic regional organizations, the growing literature on foreign policy of autocratic regimes and the traditional analysis of the United Nations. The results suggest that regime-type plays a strong role in co-sponsorship behavior: democracies co-sponsor with their peers, whereas autocracies, in line with existing findings, cooperate overall less at the UN. They do, however, prefer to co-sponsor with one another over partners of other regime-types. This seems to be particularly true in issue areas where autocratic regimes could attempt to counter democratic norm-setting, such as human rights.

    "text": "My R packages are mostly a collection of data querying and processing tools that I use frequently and hence have packaged to make my life (and hopefully that of others) in the future easier.\n\n\n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    comtradr\n    comtradr is the interface to the United\nNations Comtrade API . Comtrade provides\ncountry level shipping data for a variety of commodities, these\nfunctions allow for easy API query and data returned as a tidy data\nframe. You need a (free) API key from the UN. Maintained in the rOpenSci Universe.\n  \n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    comRex\n    comRex provides a wrapper for the Eurostat SDMX API, focusing on the Comext trade database. It allows for easy querying of EU trade data from 2002 onwards by various classification levels (HS2, HS4, HS6, CN8).\n  \n\n  \n     \n       \n         \n    milRex\n    milRex allows users to query military expenditure data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). It simplifies accessing up-to-date global military spending data and formatting it for analysis.\n  \n  \n  \n     \n       \n         \n    Rat.las\n    Ratlas makes it easy to query the data of the  \n    Atlas of Economic Complexity. \n    You need an API key for the Harvard Dataverse.\n    \n  \n  \n  \n       \n       \n         \n     EU Council Monitor\n     The EU Council Monitor is not a package, but a dashboard I wrote, which I usually use as a template, because it is modularized and lends itself to easy extension for simple visualizations."
